# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍

This project is part of my internship at **Digital Bhem**, where I developed a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## 📌 Objective
To classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using supervised ML models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Sourced from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Highly imbalanced dataset with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- SMOTE (for data balancing)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 🚀 Model Performance
- ROC AUC: ~0.91
- Precision and Recall optimized using SMOTE
